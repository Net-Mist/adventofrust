# AdventOfRust

Advent of code done in Rust.

Please note that I am in the process of learning Rust. If you want to see code written by mature Rust dev, well, you will not find it here!

* day 02: iterators, struct, enum, pattern matching
* day 03: iterators, cmp::Ordering and Counter
* day 05: nom, atoi (for &[u8] to usize parsing)

## 2022
* day 01: iterators and BinaryHeap
* day 02: int enum, pattern matching
* day 03: HashSet, chunks
* day 04: nom, atoi

* day 11: nom, complex, OOP
* day 12: BinaryHeap, Reverse, petgraph, pathfinding
* day 13: serde, matching and destructuring
* day 15: regex
